# Changes for Release

## Syntax changes
There have been some changes to syntax since the Beta as is expected. Character, conversation and goto definitions now have keywords instead of symbols to represent them: `char`, `convo` and `goto`, respectively.

## Additions

 * Added `require` keyword that allows the ability to link resources to others. Now you can use conversations from other files.
 * Convos in `project.json` file now allows a path to a folder, instead of an array of files, when looking for resources to embed.
 * Added `update` command to run module to make updating source in templates easier.

## Bug fixes

 * Fixed a bug where choices were not added to the `CommandBlock` if they were placed at the end of a file.
