# StoryDev 2
StoryDev 2 is a parser for StoryScript, a scripting language designed for interactive storytelling. It's written in Haxe which allows for cross-target development, allowing you to use your scripts in any language and on any platform. Haxe targets C++, C#, JavaScript, ActionScript, Flash, Neko, PHP, Java, Python and Lua. With frameworks such as OpenFL and Kha, StoryDev can be used for native desktop applications, web applications, mobile devices, and even the Raspberry Pi.

## Using StoryDev 2

StoryDev 2 comes in two parts: The Parser (the thing that parses your scripts), and the Implementation (the Graphical User Interface that displays and runs the parsed results).

Implementation is currently limited to HTML5, but you can implement StoryDev 2 into your engine very easily. All that is required is a user interface that is customised to work with StoryDev 2.

To implement, you can use the technical specification for exactly how StoryDev parses scripts, or you can view our tutorials.
